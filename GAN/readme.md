This folder contains the sample of GAN generated adversarial malware sample. The sample was generated with DC GAN algorithm by Radford et.al Radford, A. (2015). Unsupervised representation learning with deep convolutional generative adversarial networks. arXiv preprint arXiv:1511.06434.
The best generated sample was selected with Frechet inception Distance (FID) method.
